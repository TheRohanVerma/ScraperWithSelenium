# ScraperWithSelenium
This python code can be used to scrap data from a web page that calculates something.
For example, example.py goes to http://textalyser.net and chooses a file that is on your PC and then calculates various parameters for text in that file. 
Later, the results are scraped using selenium.
Selenium is also used to drive the google chrome and control the flow.
