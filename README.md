# ScraperWithSelenium
This python code can be used to scrap data from a web page that calculates something.
For example, example.py goes to http://textalyser.net and chooses a file that is on your PC and then calculates the lexical density of that text file. 
Later, the results are scraped using beautiful soup.
Selenium is used to drive the google chrome and control the flow.
